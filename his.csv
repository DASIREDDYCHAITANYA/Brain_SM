The key to getting 36m karma is to make a really bad call on what hobby you want to pick up and find content and post it to reddit like a psychopath for 5 years straight daily. Which is why not everyone has 36m karma. Because people have lives to live.

272,fs024v5,2020-05-27,16,"Fair question and of course mod abuse is real, a lot of past subs also were grown inorganically and the top mods tried to sell the subs or sell spots for marketers on said subs. It often ended bad for the shill and the administration dealt with it, replacing the entire mod team at times. No idea what went on behind the scenes but it seemed to be the case on multiple occasions (one having been r/natureisfuckinglit). 

Mods are volunteers. They are not contractually bound to reddit. Meaning they can do whatever they want until either their comods step in or the administration steps in. That's why any large sub with 1-2 mods only is suspicious and those individuals cannot possibly cope with the amount of mod work generated by their sub (50 or 100k+ is usually a large enough subreddit that requires a team of 5+ moderators at least).

Reddit also has a solution for that which is reporting wrongful moderator behavior here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9h7w7u/reddithelpcom_now_has_a_moderator_complaint_form/

There's a middle ground that has yet to be met. We can't do anything but try to speak about all this in a civilized way and hope the administration will do the right thing going forward.

----

Edit: Also strongly believe that limiting the amount of subs / users individual mods can moderate is a step in the right direction. As it stands some moderators have a 200,000,000+ user count when it comes down to their total moderation, across 100 or 200+ subreddits they try to moderate. It is overwhelming and not a healthy way to spend your time online, but it also seem to anger the reddit audiences so maybe a change is due. Again this would be up to the administration to roll out and not moderators.",-0.06367394179894181
280,frzkyzy,2020-05-27,10,"At the end of the day what I see on one side are mobs of users confused and mislead at who to be angry with, focus firing all their anger at moderators for changes we cannot even begin and bring forward since we are just volunteers on the platform, not employees. And on the other side I see volunteer mods who care about their communities dragged and witchunted for enforcing site wide ToS and their subreddit rules, both publicly available for all to see. 

On both sides there can be bad faith actors and being a user or being a mod can be disruptive in its own specific ways. It is up to the administration to ensure its users as well as its volunteer moderators are feeling safe and heard on the platform. Both of these things are not currently met, users feel abused and not heard and mods feel unsafe and not protected. 

I don't have solutions, but I can clearly see the problems. If the users want change, petition the administration VS harassing individual mods. If the mods want change, limit your moderation to spaces you think are safe (non political subs for one, incredibly volatile and dangerous right now) and always put your mental health first. I see a lot of my own comods developing unhealthy patterns of anxiety and paranoia dealing with volatile subs and the polarized audience that comes with it. 

Personally this reflection allowed me to revisit what I want to do online and going forward i've got big plans to exclusively direct my reddit presence and you awesome followers on here towards mental health awareness and support. 

I want to create a support space for anyone on reddit who needs a positive boost or a friendly ear(s) to listen. I'm going to be funding this entirely out of my own pocket, with giveaways and weekly donations to individuals and non profits of our choice (will be polling to do what you guys think is right).

If there's one thing I learned being online as much and working in media is that no matter who you are and what you do you'll have your own set of crazies following you around and twisting your every words and actions to fit their insane world views or personal bias. Meta conspiracy theory on reddit is its own clusterfuck but this is not exclusive to me, just like everyone else with any remote visibility online you will catch a case of the crazies. 

The AMA will be an opportunity to thoroughly reply to any and all questions within the realm of a civil discussion and a hard nope on low hanging toxic conspiracy meta reddit turbonerdism. 

You don't manage crazies, you ignore them and act according to platform rules. Something they are often too dumb to understand and apply but then cry censorship when they shoot themselves in the foot. It's comedic for the most part, minus the death threats over karma lmao. 

Do you and fuck the noise is a good motto to have <3

I try to steer clear from controversial topics whenever i can because our peace of mind is all we’ve got at the end of the day. With that being said, i do spend a considerable amount of time refreshing reddit and twitter, and i tend to just drop off relevant stories of interest when i see them. Actively trying to limit my redditing (be it moderation or shitposting or whatever) because it steals too much of my time and attention away. I have been between projects for the last few months due to covid and the global lockdowns and that allowed for more time to play on reddit. Also redditors have proven to be a priceless source of moral support (it goes both ways) during this time so i end up being here even more now.
